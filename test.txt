## Simple-SDDM2

Background="moon.png"

Path relative to the theme root directory. Most standard image file formats are allowed including support for transparency

groundImage="0.0"
## Double between 0 and 1 used for the alpha channel of a darkening overlay. Use to darken your background image on the fly.

ScaleImageCropped="true"
## Whether the image should be cropped when scaled proportionally. Setting this to false will fit the whole image instead, possibly leaving white space. This can be exploited beautifully with illustrations (try it with "undraw.svg" included in the theme).
